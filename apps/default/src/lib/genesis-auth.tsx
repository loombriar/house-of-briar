 * (#28786: an owner signing in for `/admin` landed on the public page with no
 * path onward, and apps compensated with a `sessionStorage` flag written by
 * exactly one button). The path now rides in the OIDC `state`, which

 * codes with GETDEL (single-use by design), so that second exchange fails and
 * latches an auth error over an otherwise valid, already-stored session - the
 * user sees "Sign-in could not be completed" until they refresh by hand.
 *
 * Keeping the `UserManager` here, and memoizing the in-flight exchange on it,
 * makes the second mount await the SAME exchange instead of starting a rival
 * one. This is correct independently of the remount: an auth code is
 * single-use, so two concurrent exchanges of one code are never valid.

 * 15-minute access token expires. Two gaps remain that the library leaves to
 * the app:
 *
 *  1. A new tab (or a reload after the tab's sessionStorage is gone) starts
 *     with no stored user, and nothing in `react-oidc-context` tries to sign
 *     in silently on mount. The auth server keeps a session cookie for this
 *     app, so ONE `signinSilent()` attempt at mount signs the user back in
 *     without the login form. `login_required` (no session) is the normal
 *     signed-out state and is swallowed; the app's own sign-in button remains
 *     the visible path.
 *  2. When a refresh is refused (`invalid_grant`: the chain was revoked,
 *     replayed, expired, or the account was disabled) the library raises
 *     `silentRenewError` but leaves `isAuthenticated` true with a dead token.
 *     Dropping the user here flips the app to signed-out so it shows sign-in
 *     instead of failing every gateway call with 401 until a manual refresh.
 *     Timeouts and 5xx are left alone: the library retries those itself.
