# House of Briar

A full-stack storefront prototype with a designer portal, validated multi-photo uploads, and a published-only gallery. The shop loads directly from the same SQLite-backed listing store used by the designer workspace, so a second gallery index is not required.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## Designer flow

1. Open the Designer portal.
2. Sign in with a token from `.env`.
3. Add a listing and upload multiple images at once.
4. Save as a draft or submit.
5. If review is enabled, the listing stays hidden until admin approval.
